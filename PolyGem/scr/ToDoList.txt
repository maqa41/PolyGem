=============== Scene API ===============

	>> Add scene graph.
	>> Add nodes for objects, cameras and lights.
	>> Implement grouping and parent-child relationships between objects.
	>> Implement camera system.
	>> Implement camera properties such as position, orientation, field of view, and depth of field settings.
	>> Implement 2D lighting effects, integrate lighting nodes into the scene graph.
	>> Implement shadow casting and shadow receivers.
	>> Toggle the visibility of individual objects, groups, or layers to simplify complex scenes.
	>> Provide locking mechanisms to prevent accidental changes to objects.

================ Mesh API ================

	>> Creation and removal of vertices.
	>> Vertex selection (for editing and manipulation).
	>> Creation and removal of edges.
	>> Connection of vertices to form edges.
	>> Edge attributes (e.g., smoothing groups, visibility).
	>> Edge selection and manipulation.
	>> Creation and removal of faces.
	>> Face attributes (e.g., material assignments, UV mapping).
	>> Face selection and manipulation.
	>> Triangulation and polygon filling algorithms.
	>> Subdivision algorithms for refining mesh details.
	>> Deformation tools (e.g., bend, twist, taper) for modifying the mesh.
	>> Scaling, rotating, and translating the entire mesh.
	>> Local transformations for individual components (vertices, edges, faces).
	>> Boolean operations (union, subtraction, intersection) for combining or splitting meshes.
	>> Extrusion and beveling for creating 3D-like effects in 2D meshes.
	>> Selecting vertices, edges, and faces individually or in groups.
	>> Transforming selected components collectively.
	>> Smooth and sharp edge creasing.
	>> UV unwrapping tools for applying textures to the mesh.

	>> Interpolation between keyframes to create smooth motion.
	>> A timeline that allows users to manage and visualize the animation over time.
	>> Keyframe manipulation on the timeline, including adding, deleting, and moving keyframes.
	>> Scrubbing (dragging the playhead to preview animations).
	>> Support for animation curves (e.g., linear, ease-in, ease-out) to control the timing and acceleration of animations.
	>> Bezier curve editors for fine-tuning animation curves.
	>> Tools for creating and manipulating skeletons (bone systems) for character animation.
